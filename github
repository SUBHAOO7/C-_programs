As we know GitHub is the best platform for version control and for open source project, I am going to make proper use of it. At GitHub, I use to track my project while working on a team also I am able to contribute to some projects. If I get GitHub Private Repository at free, I will be able to store the code of my upcoming startup and my team mates will also be able to contribute to it.
Also, Student Backpack will help me to gain more knowledge using various tools.
